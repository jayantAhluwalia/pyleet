This repository contains my LeetCode solutions.

## How it works

The repository is organized with the following folders:
- **lib**: This folder contains the solutions, where file names directly correspond to the problem number.
- **tests**: This folder contains the expected results. Each line represents a result for a different use case.
- **inputs**: This folder contains the inputs for each problem. Each line represents an input parameter. Use "###" to indicate that the next line is an input for a different test case.

## Usage command

To run the solutions, use the following command:
`python3 run.py <leetcode problem number>`


## File Formats

- Solution file format: `<problem number>.py`
- Tests file format: `<problem number>.txt`
- Inputs file format: `<problem number>_inp.txt`
